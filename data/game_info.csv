In the first part of the fight, it will often use its snout and its large frame to attack players, crushing those who are stubborn enough to get in its path. It will erratically rampage through the battlefield, making it hard for players to catch up to it. Once its health reaches a certain threshold, it will throw a tantrum, fully utilizing the Lightning kept within its body. Its basic attacks will be infused with Lightning, creating wide explosions and adding Lightning properties to their physical attacks. Players are generally suggested to stay underneath or beside the Gaping Jaw, avoiding the direction of its jaws.","A colossal, crooked black frame capable of harboring lightning, with massive jaws, lined with grinding teeth to devour anything and everything it encounters",,,,,,"Poison, Scarlet Rot, Frostbite, and Sleep","Madness and Blight","Lightning and Fire"

Faurtis is a large, scorpion-like creature that used telegraphed attacks such as pincer strikes, slams, and lunges, allowing players to react appropriately to its attacks. As for Gnoster, it spends most of its time flying in the air, making it difficult for melee-based Nightfarers to retaliate against it. Throughout the fight, Gnoster will be throwing magical projectiles targeted at the player, which can be avoided by rolling through them or by running away. These two enemies will have a collective health bar, so attacking either Gnoster or Faurtis will deduct from only one big HP.

Equilibrious Beast,boss,"Equilibrious Beast is a representation of balance, a demonic goat-like Nightlord standing on its hind legs. The encounter with it starts with an interaction between players and the Scale-bearing Merchant, who will offer players a buff in exchange for a negative effect, such as gaining Stamina while reducing the player's maximum HP and FP. Players may also opt out of the interaction, declining the merchant's offer. After taking (or not taking) a deal with the merchant, it will transform into the Equilibrious Beast. It uses its quarterstaff for physical attacks, casts Incantations from the Golden Order, and Madness-related spells. The fight with it will only have one phase, as the boss will not gain anything or become stronger in the latter part of the fight. Equilibrious Beast will have the same attack strings, occasionally using quick projectiles to pressure players into playing defensively. Even if it utilizes Madness for its attacks, it is extremely vulnerable against it. Players can use spells that increase Madness build-up on Equilibrious Beast, causing it to enter a frenzied state where it uses its quarterstaff instead of casting its powerful spells. However, due to Madness-related gear being scarce in Nightreign, players can also use weapons with Fire, Slash, and Holy damage, as Equilibrious Beast is also weak against those damage types.","A goat-headed being who pretends to be a man, said to be able to use a dubious form of alchemy. Counterfeit gold causes loss of sanity, beckoning madness. However, those who foment madness are sure to succumb to the selfsame malady in the end.",,,,,,"Holy, Poison, Scarlet Rot, and Madness","Sleep and Blight","Magic"
Darkdrift Knight,boss,"Darkdrift Knight is a centaur-like Nightlord that wields a lance in combat. This boss uses its speed to reach players with its long lance, making it difficult for players to gauge the safe distance between them and the Darkdrift Knight. Most of Fulghor's attacks in Phase 1 are telegraphed, as the boss will mostly use physical attacks to strike players. However, in Phase 2, it will gain new moves that can be hard for players to avoid if they want to retreat to heal or reset.","An ancient centaur consumed with battle. His fervor for the gods he serves yet burns within, wielding a sacred form of the Night's power. According to legend, the mighty radiant gods were able to conceal themselves in the roar of the thunder.",,,,,,"Lightning","Madness and Blight","Holy"
Fissure in the Fog,boss,"Fissure in the Fog is a massive draconic Nightlord covered in sharp spikes, with towering wings and claws for attacking Nightfarers. Throughout the fight, Caligo attacks with its body, using its tail and limbs to swipe over the arena, while also unleashing Ice and Frost magic to slow down players. Early in the encounter, Caligo primarily uses physical attacks that can be dodged with well-timed rolls. Occasionally, it breathes frost to both damage and hinder players, leaving behind areas with lingering ice. Once its health drops below a certain threshold, Caligo summons a thick mist that obstructs the players' vision and briefly retreats. As the fog clears, players will realize that it was a trap, as Caligo prepares for a devastating attack.","A prehistoric dragon which lurks within the fog. The great shadowy pair of eyes, framed in frigid mist, are said to appear at history's great junctures.

Night Aspect,boss,"Night Aspect will first be encountered as The Shape of Night, a spectral knight covered in tattered cloth over its purple armor. At first, it will be using its sword to swing at players, having basic attack strings such as stabs, slashes, although these attacks can be a bit unpredictable of when they will hit. The Shape of Night will be moving slowly until its health reaches around 60%, where it will draw the greatsword behind its back and start using it. It will then use attacks that are faster than the first phase, quickly dashing towards players or swinging its weapons consecutively. Once The Shape of Night is defeated, it will start emitting darkness out of its body, which will then abruptly cut to reveal its true form, Heolstor the Nightlord (Night Aspect). In this form, Heolstor sheds the tattered cloth covering its armor, and its greatsword (Dark Moon Greatsword in Elden Ring) is fully imbued. Heolstor is significantly stronger than when it was The Shape of Night, using teleportation and its enchanted sword to defeat unprepared Nightfarers. Its dash attacks will become faster than its previous iteration, catching players off guard. Heolstor can teleport next to players who are keeping their distance from the boss, making it unsafe even when players disengage the boss.","Beyond the boundless Night there lies the hazy figure of a person. That is the Night's origin, and enemy to the world. 'The signs shall reveal - where the footprints of the Primordial Nightlord lead.'",,,,,,"Holy and Lightning","Madness, Blight, Blood Loss, Poison, and Frostbite","None"
